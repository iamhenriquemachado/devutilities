            answer:
              "Base64 is a binary-to-text encoding scheme that represents binary data in an ASCII string format. It's commonly used to encode binary data, such as images or files, for transmission over text-based protocols.",

            question: "Why would I need to encode or decode Base64?",
            answer:
              "Base64 encoding is useful when you need to transmit binary data over media that only supports text, such as email or JSON. Decoding is necessary to convert the Base64 string back to its original form.",

            answer:
              "No, Base64 is not an encryption method. It's simply an encoding scheme and doesn't provide any security. Anyone can decode Base64 data. For security, you should use proper encryption methods.",

            question: "Can I encode images to Base64?",
            answer:
              "Yes, images can be encoded to Base64, which is commonly done for embedding small images directly in HTML or CSS. However, this tool is designed for text. For images, you would need a specific file-to-Base64 converter.",

          {
            question: "How can I use Base64 in my code?",
            answer:
              "Most programming languages have built-in functions for Base64 encoding and decoding. For example, in JavaScript, you can use btoa() for encoding and atob() for decoding.",
